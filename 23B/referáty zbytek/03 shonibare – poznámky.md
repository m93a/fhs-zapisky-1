    * „I have dressed the Andrewses in costumes made of African fabric. The origins of the fabrics are important because this kind of cloth is not indigenous to Africa at all. It is based on Indonesian printed batik designs, which were industrially manufactured in Holland and England and then sold to the West African market. Initially, when the Dutch went to Indonesia, one of their colonies, they adopted local batik printing, but to facilitate trade they produced the fabrics industrially. They tried to sell them in Indonesia, but such industrially produced fabrics were not popular there. So the Dutch tried them in West Africa, where they were extremely well liked. At this stage, as Africa was being colonized, people were being educated and moving into administrative types of work. So spending time hand weaving their fabrics on looms was not practical. It was faster and cheaper to buy something manufactured. Of course, now the printing technique has been adopted by Africans as well, but the origins of the designs are Indonesian. And, to add another layer of complexity, I purchased these culturally hybrid "African" fabrics from Brixton market in London, where they are popular with African-Europeans and black British people who want to identify with an idealized, invented homeland“ (Give & Take Conversations, 2014)

 * glitch feminismus
    * „Když genderujeme tělo, utváříme si doměnky o fungování těla, o jeho sociopolitickém stavu, jeho stálosti. Když je tělo specifikováno do mužské či ženské osoby, pak tělo preformuje gender jako svou partituru, vedeno souborem pravidel a požadavků, které potvrzují a ověřují lidskost onoho individua. Tělo, které se vzpírá jazykové rodovosti, nebo zůstává nerozluštitelné v rámci binárního přiřazování, je tělo, které odmítá hrát podle partitury. Toto nekonání, či neperformance, je glitch. Glitch je druh odmítání.
    V rámci glitch feminismu je glitch oslavován jako nástroj odmítání, strategie nekonání. Cílem tohoto glitche je navrátit do abstraktní podoby to, co bylo vtlačeno do nepohodlné a špatně definované hmoty: tělo.“
    * „Brutalita tohoto nejistého stavu se projevuje zejména v neustálém očekávání, že jakožto těla budeme kontinuálně utvrzovat performování genderu, které odpovídá binárnímu rozdělení, abychom dodržovalÿ předpisy každodennosti. Jak napsal politolog a antropolog James C. Scott, ‚čitelnost [se stává] podmínkou manipulace‘.“

 * genuine pretending
    * coined by Paul D'Ambrosio, co-developed by Hans-Georg Moeller
    * „The understanding that identity is both paradoxical and incongruous – and this is what allows to establish identity. Trying to get identity right, to make it not paradoxical, or to make it no longer incongruous is an impossible task.“ (youtu.be/jGMq2aVfJxc)
    * „Genuine pretending [is] manifested through [Zhuangzi]'s humorous or humoristic subversions of sincere attempts to fill one's roles. [...] Here, humoristic communication has the characteristic that it is intended to relax us and cause pleasure through distancing us from a serious situation, sometimes through a violation of expectations or incongruity based on paradox, irony, nonsense, or the like. [Humor is] dissolving moral fear by undermining the moral mind-set. Humor, on this reading, presents an amoral response to the demands of morality by stressing their contingency. The word-play and examples of genuine pretending do not reveal a real self, but dis-covers the lack of any such thing -- it serves as a denial of essence, or anything beyond merely contingent facts of our lives.“
    * „Genuine pretending is manifested by the "genuine person" or zhenren, who plays his roles well while investing them with no value. These zhenren have a number of features of Daoist sages: they know only the limits of their knowledge; they embody the ideal of transformation, constantly taking on new roles but not identifying with them; they engage in the free and easy wandering of the heart, at ease wherever they happen to be, employing intense sensitivity in perceiving it (166-7). They may be part of society, but do not invest its norms with value, and thus embody a healthy response to the exacting demands of Confucian society.“
    * „We use this notion of genuine pretending to describe what the Daoist existential position is. More simply put, genuine pretending is the existential condition that everyone shares. So, we're all genuine pretending all the time. The problem is that we're not aware of it and we develop other notions of what and how we are. To say a little bit more, genuine pretending is of course a paradoxical term, and the idea is that we shape an identity and then genuinely become who we are through pretending. Now, what is pretending – pretending has two meanings, of course it means to pretend something that you may not essentially be, but tied to this is the usage related to child play. [Pretending] is a very common form of child play, you for example pretend you're king and queen. In this way, the identities that we assume are an effect of pretending. And the idea is that this is not the case just in child play, this is the case throughout society – all social identities are socially constructed, as we could say nowadays. This is not, paradoxically, a violation of genuineness, but to the contrary, through this kind of pretending, through this kind of social construction, social reality and what we percieve as genuine is therefore constructed. [...] This insight can lead to some form of existential ease, and this is the main theme in Daoism: the main purpose in practical Daoist philosophy would be through recognition and affirmation of genuine pretending achieve a form of existential ease.“ (youtu.be/3CMfG001nAk)
