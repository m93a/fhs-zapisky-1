  * relevance vs pertinence
    * _That is relevant which has any traceable connection, especially logical connection, with the thing under consideration and which has significance in any degree for those who are engaged in such consideration [examples omitted]. ... That is pertinent which is so decisively or significantly relevant that it touches the real point at issue or contributes materially to the understanding of what is under discussion or to the solution of that which is in question._
