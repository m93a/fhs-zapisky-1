## Immanuel Kant
* theoretical
  * reason, understanding, judgement, imagination
* practical
  * morality, ethics
  * categorical imperative
* phenomenal (= the thing that i see), noumenal (= the _actual_ thing that i don't see)
* we're determined but also free
* judgement to unify the theoretical & practical
  * judgement ~ deciding the truth value of a proposition
* beauty
  * agreeable – delightful to some people ig, but it is based in subjective interest
  * beauty – delightful independently of interest
  * beautiful is something that people *should* enjoy even in the case they don't need it
    * tied to the normative framework, it doesn't matter whether anyone actually *does* enjoy it
* purposiveness
  * free = not determined
    * not as in “free speech” but as in “gluten free”
    * freedom from an _ancestral concept_, or from a purpose
  * Kant is not a dualist in the Cartesian sense
    * said very vaguely: he synthesises deterministi
  * purposefulness without a purpose
* necessity

* beauty is what points us to morality
